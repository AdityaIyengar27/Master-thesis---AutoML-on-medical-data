I would like to thank Prof. Dr. Andreas Dengel for providing me with the opportunity to write my thesis in deep learning. I would also like to thank him for enabling the smooth completion of the thesis.

I am also deeply indebted to my supervisor Dr. Jens Krüger for his immeasurable support throughout the thesis. I would like to thank him for giving me the freedom to explore this topic and implement the ideas. This thesis would have been practically impossible without his interminable support. I shall ever cherish the time spent working with him on this thesis and the various topics we discussed over time. Ever grateful for his unfailing support during the tenure.

I would also like to thank my peers at Fraunhofer ITWM, for all the technical assistance during these times. I would like to thank Dominik Loroch and Nico Weber, for their valuable help, for assistance and guidance for the various topics. 

Lastly, I’d like to thank my parents (Prasanna Iyengar and Y S Savithri), my fiancé (Swathi) and my siblings. This would not have been possible without their constant support and encouragement.
